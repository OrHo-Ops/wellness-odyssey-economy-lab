"""Wellness Odyssey: pre-launch game economy simulation.

Every player in this file is SYNTHETIC. The game has not launched and there is
no player data. Inputs come from assumptions.csv and carry one of four labels:

    verified      a rule of the game, read from its implementation
    illustrative  a synthetic stand-in for a confidential production value
                  (the wheel's reward table)
    assumption    a modelling choice about behaviour: how much a player walks,
                  how often the app is opened
    hypothetical  a commercial input with no evidence behind it

    python economy_model.py

runs the checks, the simulation and the scenarios, then writes two charts and
four tables to outputs/.
